        <h1>Accessing the Component's Parent Container:</h1><br />
        <p>In the connectedCallback(), you can access the component's parent container using this.parentElement. This
            allows you to interact with the container and retrieve information or manipulate elements within it. For 
            instance, you might want to adjust the styling of the container based on the presence of your component.</p>

            <h1>Communicating with the Document:</h1><br />
            <p>The connectedCallback() can also be used to establish communication with the overall document. In the example, an
                 event listener is added to the document for the 'click' event. When the document is clicked, the handleDocumentClick 
                 method is invoked. This is a simple example, but you can use this pattern to coordinate behavior with the broader 
                 environment, responding to events or conditions in the document.</p>
